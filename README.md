# FGF14-repeat-expansion

In our study we investigated the repeat expansion in the FGF14 gene of SCA27B patients. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood and was then analyzed with
long-range PCR, Sanger sequencing, Nanopore sequencing, and PacBio sequencing. We uploaded the bash and R script for the analysis of the repeat motif.
