# FGF14-repeat-expansion

In our study we investigated the repeat expansion in the FGF14 gene of SCA27B patients. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood and was then analyzed with long-range PCR, Sanger sequencing, Nanopore sequencing, and PacBio sequencing. We uploaded the bash script and reference for the analysis of the repeat motif for the long-read sequencing data. For the analysis the software NCRF was used (https://github.com/makovalab-psu/NoiseCancellingRepeatFinder). The script is optimized for multiplexed long-read sequencing approaches.
